                  This research was conducted as part of our curiosity during a road trip to the Grampians National Park. As we were driving along the highway, we wondered why the speed limit was only set to a max of 110km/h. Our curiosity led us to put together this short investigation to see whether the speed of the car is the main cause of accidents. Our research is as follows:<br><br>

                  A commonly accepted statement, which has been proven over the years is that a speeding vehicle has a higher chance of causing a road accident <sup>[1][3]</sup>. This being said, the affected people are not only those who were driving the vehicle but also those seated inside the vehicle at the time of crash, pedestrians hit and injured due to the crash and subsequently, the property (items on the road, car) damaged. The people involved in the crash could be affected by just a minor injury like a bruise or a broken bone, or could be affected by a severe injury leading to loss of blood or a body part, or worse, could lead to death. This is a matter of public safety and identifying the risks of speeding on the roads. Different roads have variable speed limits at different times of the day. In Victoria, the built-up area has a restricted speed limit of 50km/h, but in rural areas away from the city and suburbs, the speed limit is up to 100km/h <sup>[16]</sup>. This could vary based on the requirement of the area or a time of the day, e.g. icy winds in an area, school timings, etc. <sup>[18]</sup> Variable speed limits are imposed mainly to avert the possibility of vehicular crashes at times or areas that are susceptible to danger. These rules, in turn, pertain to roads in and around Melbourne too. The speed limit of the roads gives a brief estimate of the speeds at which the cars could be travelling at. For instance, on a road with a speed limit of 40km/h (due to it being a residential area), a vehicle could be expected to drive fastest at 50km/h although it could be breaking the law. The damage done by a car crash on this road could be less severe than the damage done by a car crash on a road that has the speed limit of 100km/h. This hypothesis is set to be tested in this study, to find if the severity of a car crash is associated with the speed limit of the road. The severity of a vehicular crash is defined at the time of creating a police record <sup>[15]</sup>, which is discussed in detail later in the report.

                    Factors like lane width, junction density, and traffic flow played a very important role in vehicle crashes that were related to high speeds could be attributed to the fact that there were higher crash rates in urban areas than rural areas <sup>[12]</sup>. It could be argued that the road types could skew the results in a way that cannot be theoretically applied to the roads in Australia. Thus, in a separate study conducted at the Monash University Accident Research Centre in 1991. Although this study was conducted much before the previous researches mentioned, similar results were achieved in the end. The research lead by Fildes et. al. showcased a strong relationship between the frequency of accidents and the types of roads in Australia <sup>[6]</sup>.<br><br>
                    <img alt="car_speed_blog" src="../images/car_speed_blog/graph2_background.png" style="height:250px;" align="right">
                    As seen, there are higher frequency of vehicular crashes on urban roads although the speed limit is less than that of the rural roads. As mentioned before, factors like junction density and traffic flow could be a huge contributing factor to this relationship. Thus, enforcing a speed limit based on the area and traffic flow of the road is highly necessary. With regards to the increasing number fatalities in Victoria, the speed limits around built-up areas was reduced from 60km/h to 50km/h from January 22, 2001 <sup>[8]</sup>. In an effort to determine the effects of this imposition, an analysis of the accidents within 5 months of the reduction was conducted by the Monash University Accident Research Centre. The outcome showed how beneficial the reduction of the speed limit of the roads was. It was found that the overall casualties and serious injuries of people involved in crashes reduced by almost 40%. This involves people in the vehicle and pedestrians affected by the crash. This clearly indicated that imposing strict speed limits increased the safety of the drivers and pedestrians equally. This indicated the the severity of the accidents also reduced with the reduction of speed limits. No concrete study has been conducted in order to prove this implication. Thus, this research aims directly at finding a plausible association between the severity of car crashes on the roads in Melbourne and the subsequent speed limits.

                  This research project uses the open data, Vehicle Crash Statistics in Victoria, obtained from the VicRoads <sup>[16]</sup>. The data file consists of various informative datasets including the accident, location, atmospheric condition, road surface condition and description of vehicle/s involved. Nevertheless, it contains record of road vehicle accident across Victoria from beginning of 2006 till the end of 2016. The severity of the crash, using the ‘police severity’ identification method (Figure 3.1), and the speed zone of the accident location was recorded in the data. Other confounding factors of interest includes types of accident, day of the week, road description, region, atmospheric condition, road condition, and vehicle body and type. The data was pre-processed, manipulated, explored and analysed using R, where the relationship between the different datasets were established through the primary key, accident number.relationship between the frequency of accidents and the types of roads in Australia <sup>[6]</sup>.<br><br>

                  In total there were 284,756 records, however, since the dataset records large vehicle such as trucks, trailers, buses and motorcycles, these were removed as we are only interested in car. Considering that the aim and hypothesis of this research involves around severity and speed zone, the rows which did not exhibit these data, or exhibit uninformatively (such as ‘other speed zones’) were excluded. This results to a final total number 193,675 records of car-related accidents. Table 2.1 summarises the characteristics of the pre-processed car accident dataset that will be used for analysis and exploration in this research.

                  In most cases injuries does occur with accidents (99.74%), there were only small numbers of fatal accidents (1.5%), with some serious accident (32.08%), but most of it are just some non-serious injuries (66.42%). Figure 3.3 depicts that most of the accidents occur in low speed zone of 60km (38.7133%) and 50km (17.4932). There are some accidents in higher speed zone such as 80km (16.2%) and 100km (12.58%).<br><br>Most of the accident that had occurred are collisions with vehicle/s and collision with a fixed object. Each of these accidents type was also grouped according to different speed zones. At lower speed zone, collision with vehicle high in comparison with others, however as the speed zone increases, the number of collision with a fixed object arises, hence Figure 1.6 shows that bar 1 (collision with a fixed object) is 3⁄4 of bar 3 (collision with vehicle). Figure 1.7 portrays that as the speed limit increases, the chance of collision with a fixed object rises, and collision with vehicle decreases.

                <h4>Design and Statistical Methods</h4>
                <p style="text-align:justify">
                  As mentioned in the background, there have been a plethora of researches conducted based on the speed limit and accident severity. There are numerous factors that could contribute to the car accident and its severity, and due to this, it is important to identify if speed zone/limit (provides a close indication of the car’s speed prior to the accident), have a significant association with accident severity.

                <h5 style="font-size: 13px">Random Forest for Feature Importance</h5>
                <p style="text-align:justify">
                  To find the most likely predictors that will help in a near accurate classification of new data, a type of decision trees, Random Forests, can be implemented. Variables from the data set are randomly selected and a decision tree is created <sup>[19]</sup>. This process is repeated until there are enough decision trees for comparison. The analogy of a random forest, the decision trees are grouped together to form a set of trees, or a “forest”. Based on the calculated Gini index <sup>[10]</sup>, and for large data sets, having numerous predictors, Random Forest could also be used to rank the importance of variables, such as identifying the most relevant variables that seem to have a significant impact on predicting the readmission of the patients in ICU. It works by measuring the importance in the data, given:
                  <img alt="car_speed_blog" src="../images/car_speed_blog/eq_methods.png" style="height:20px; display: block; margin: 0 auto">
                  Out of bag errors are found during the conduction of the forest, these errors are averaged over all forests, whereby features that have a large score are considered as more important than those with a smaller score.<br><br>
                  Ever since its inception, the algorithm has been used in various researches and applications to help find the best classifier for the specific prediction variable in the target data set <sup>[4]</sup>. From ecology to medicine to astronomy, random forests have proven its worth by being able to successfully predict and classify data sets in the right classes. In medicine, specifically for cancer, random forest was used to correctly predict pathological samples for breast cancer by using feature selection to identify genes that are biologically significant <sup>[5],</sup> and in another study, the same was used to classify cancer microarray data based on a variety of gene sets <sup>[11]</sup>. Similarly, random forests are used in this study to identify the most beneficial predictors from the data set that will help determine the association between the severity of the accident with the speed zone. However, the cons of random forest are that it is biased in favour of variables that have more levels. Hence, the result from Random Forest from datasets that have high number of levels are less reliable, but this can be solved using partial permutation <sup>[20]</sup>. In the case of the dataset used in this study, the number of levels is not significantly high, hence it is likely not to be affected by this problem.

                <br>
                <h5 style="font-size: 13px">Chi Square Test</h5>
                <p style="text-align:justify">
                  The Chi Square statistic is a non-parametric test to analyse the relationship between independent groups of variables by formulating a contingency table to analyse the association between the two variables <sup>[14]</sup>. This test is beneficial to find a standing relationship between variables that are not continuous by nature. In researches conducted in the past that involved independent variables like genders vs. depressive symptoms <sup>[7]</sup> or types of water consumed and their preferences <sup>[13]</sup>, the Chi Square test of fitness was used to determine the association without having the need to convert the data types. This is calculated as follows:
                  <img alt="car_speed_blog" src="../images/car_speed_blog/eq_methods2.png" style="height:30px; display: block; margin: 0 auto">
                  Where O is the Observed (the actual count of cases in each cell of the table) E is the Expected value
                  χ<sup>2</sup> Is the cell Chi-square value
                  ∑χ<sup>2</sup> Is the formula instruction to sum all the cell Chi-square values
                  χ<sup>2i−j</sup> is the i−j is the correct notation to represent all the cells, from the first cell (i) to the last cell (j). The expected value E is calculated as:
                  <img alt="car_speed_blog" src="../images/car_speed_blog/eq_methods3.png" style="height:40px; display: block; margin: 0 auto">
                  Where MR represents the row marginal for that cell,
                  MC represents the column marginal for that cell, and
                  n represents the total sample size.
                  Our study includes testing two independent variables: the severity of the crash and the speed limit of the roads. Finding the relationship between the two would require the use of the Chi Square test.

                    Figure 4.1 shows that Day of Week is the most important variable in classifying severity, with speed zone being second. Since the scope of the research is related to speed zone, the random forest does rank speed zone as being highly important in this classification problem, consequently, it is a contributing factor to different accident severities.<br><br>
                    Furthermore, for our analysis, we want to see if there exist some causal relational between speed and accidents. Our first observation when we explore the data is that, most number of accidents are occurring at 60kmph speed zone. Then digging deeper, we find out that the cause of accident occurring more is collision with vehicle and collision with fixed object. Two factors that questions our hypothesis of speed having a greater impact on the number of accidents are:<br><br>
                    1.There is no linear increase between speed and accidents in our data and furthermore for speed zones more than 100 kmph there is a drastic fall in number of accidents.<br>
                    2.Linear increase in number of accidents due to collision with fixed objects with higher speed zones.<br><br>
                    The first factor does not necessarily help us to draw our conclusion that there is no relation between number of accidents and speed as the average traffic on those speed zones is not provided in that dataset. The second factor helps us to understand that there are other factors like training of the drivers, type of the road, lights on the road etc playing an enormous impact in the number of accidents. When we observe that these collisions are mostly occurring during rain and in wet roads. From this analysis, we understand it is not the speed zone but rather the other factors like weather, type of road which is more relatable to number of accidents occurring. In addition to that we do at chi-square test trying to figure out if we could say if there is a relation between the severity of the accident with the speed zone at which the accident occurred. In our data, we have 4 severity levels, 1 being the most severe one. As severity level 4 has only 5 occurrence we do not take that into account. Thus, the chi-square test is done with 9 different speed zones and 3 severity level to find out if there exist relation between speed zones and accident severity level.<br><br>

                    Null Hypothesis, H0: Speed zone has the greatest impact on accident severity level.<br>
                    Alternative Hypothesis, H1: Speed Zone does not have the greatest impact on accident severity level.<br>

                  <p style="text-align:justify">
                    As the chi-square test rejects our hypothesis we can say that even in terms of accident severity level we cannot say that in higher speed zones we will have severe accidents. Based on all our analysis we have not found any strong ground to claim that speed limit is the most significant factor in terms of accidents.

                    The objective of the study was to determine there was a significant association between speed limit/zone and the severity of car accident. The vehicle crash accident dataset was obtained from VicRoads and analysed. Random Forest was used as a method to identify variables that were deemed important, in which it selected Speed Zone as being second most important. This showed that speed zone is an important contributing factor in classifying accident severities. Chi-square test was used to identify the association between speed zone and severity. Based on the result obtained from this, the p-value obtained was close to 0, hence it was lower than the significant level.<br><br> Although random forest identifies speed zone as one of the important variable, the chi-square test study shows that speed zone is not associated with accident severity, hence is it not statistically significant. Due to this, more research is encouraged in this area as there were some limitations with this research such as the exact speed of the car and the number of cars driving in each speed zone in Victoria should be utilized and compared to draw a more robust conclusion.
